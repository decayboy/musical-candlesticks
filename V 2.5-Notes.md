# Verison 2.5 Upgrades
Multi-Asset Sonification
-Assign different instruments (via MIDI channels) to multiple markets.

- Example:
>> BTC → bass (channel 1)
>> 
>> ETH → melody (channel 2)
>> 
>> SPY → harmony (channel 3)


Volume Spikes → Percussion
> Detect unusually high volume → trigger a percussion hit (e.g., drum sound).

RSI / EMA → Tempo or Mood Shift

Calculate a simple RSI or moving average to shift note duration or scale.

> High RSI = fast tempo (frenzy).

> Low RSI = slow tempo (calm).

Humanization & Swing
> Randomize velocity and timing slightly to feel “played” not robotic.

> Optionally add swing (delay every second note).
